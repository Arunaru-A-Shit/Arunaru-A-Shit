Arunaru-A-Shit!

WARNING:
SOMETIMES MY .AIN FILE ENDS UP CORRUPTED OR SOMETHING AFTER WORKING FOR MONTHS
MAKE A BACK UP OF YOUR ORIGINAL .AIN FILE
THIS SHIT COULD EASLIY FUCK UP YOUR GAME AND I HAVE NO IDEA IF I HAVE FUCKED UP SOME OF THE GAMES MECHANICS SOMEHOW
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
IF THIS HAPPENS REPATCH YOUR ORIGINAL .AIN FILE.

FOR SOME REASONS GITHUB SEEMS TO OCCASIONALLY DECIDE THAT THE JAPANESE TEXT I UPLOADED IS GIBBERISH IN THE RAW. SO MAKE SURE THAT IF THE RAW IS GIBBERISH TO MANUALLY COPY AND PASTE THE ACCURATE TEXT FROM THE PAGE.

As of 11/02/2019 I may or may not be occasionaly working on this.

Click the + mark next to the text and click the + mark next to Used By

Right click the place it is used by and select Show in Explorer

Put your mouse cursor over Arunaru's fuckup and click Arunaru' fuck up

If you cannot find Arunaru's fuckup quickly consider clicking Edit, Show Find Toolbar and then typing in the text there.

Press any letter key on the keyboard

Select Yes to saving the .jar

Edit the file as you see fit.

Make sure to save the file after you edit it. You can do that by closing the tab

Then upload it to the github I guess, fuck man, I don't know how github works. 

¯\_( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)_/¯

While I have changed arquebus to muskets already, I think I will hold off on changing things like Onmyoji and ashigaru till I reach a point in which I think that I've fixed all other errors becuase I like Onmyoji and ashigaru, and making a fork for this would be annoying.

TODO:

Find the actual context of the uses of "god" becuase some of them might be positive and some might be negetive and I can't tell who is even saying what with AinDecompiler
